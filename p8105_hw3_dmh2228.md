# Problem 1: Instacart

``` r
data("instacart")
```

There are a total of 15 variables. There are 1384617 rows and 15
columns. Examples of key variables include order ID, product ID, user
ID, product name, aisle ID, aisle number, etc.

# Number of aisles and most items ordered from aisles

``` r
instacart_df = 
  instacart |>

  summarize(n_obs = n())
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

There are 134 aisles. The aisles that the most items are ordered from
are: fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and packaged vegetable fruits.

# Number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
aisle_df = 
  instacart |>
  count(aisle_id) |>

There are a total of 22 variables. There are 10625 rows and 22 columns.

# 7 or more locations in states in 2002 and 2010

``` r
locations_2002 = 
brfss_smart2010_df |>

  summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    n_sites = n_distinct(locationdesc)
    ) |>
  filter(n_sites >= 7) |>
  select(locationabbr)
```

In 2002, the states that were observed at 7 or more sites are c(“CT”,
“FL”, “MA”, “NC”, “NJ”, “PA”).

In 2010, the states that were observed at 7 or more sites are c(“CA”,
“CO”, “FL”, “MA”, “MD”, “NC”, “NE”, “NJ”, “NY”, “OH”, “PA”, “SC”, “TX”,
“WA”).

# Average data_value across locations within a state for ‘Excellent’ responses

  group_by(locationabbr, year) |>
  mutate(
    mean_data_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)

excellent_plot =

```

The `average data value` fluctuates by `year` for most states. The
`average data value` appears to decrease over time.

# Distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State for 2006 and 2010

``` r
ny2006_data =

ggplot(ny2006_data, aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = locationdesc)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Data value distribution in responses among NY locations in 2006",
    x = "Response",
    y = "Data value",
    color = "County"
  )

ny2010_data =
  brfss_smart2010_df |>
  filter(locationabbr == "NY", year == "2010") |>
  drop_na(response)

ny2010_plot =
ggplot(ny2010_data, aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = locationdesc)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Data value distribution in responses among NY locations in 2010",
    x = "Response",
    y = "Data value",

```

<img src="p8105_hw3_dmh2228_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

`2006` and `2010` have a similar distribution of `data_value` for
responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State. `2010`
has more locations within NY state.

  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

``` r
sex_education_table
```

| sex    | education | count |
|:-------|:----------|------:|
| Female | Level 1   | 40320 |
| Female | Level 2   | 33120 |
| Female | Level 3   | 84960 |
| Male   | Level 1   | 38880 |

| Male   | Level 3   | 80640 |

``` r
sex_education_age_plot =
  ggplot(final_nhanes_data, aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +     
  geom_density(alpha = .5, adjust = .5) +
  labs(

  )

sex_education_age_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_dmh2228_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="90%" />

The highest density for both female and male participants within the
third level of education is the younger age group ranging from 20 to 30
years old. The highest densities for female participants within the
second level of education is in the older age group ranging from 60 to
80 years old. However, for the male participants within the second level
of education, the highest density is among the younger population.
Within the first level of education, the density increases with age for
female participants. The highest density for male participants within
the first level of education is in the middle-aged group ranging from 40
to 50 years old.

# Total activity by sex across education levels

``` r
nhanes_total_activity_data =
  final_nhanes_data |>
  group_by(seqn) |>
  mutate(
    total_activity = sum(mims)
    )

  ggplot(nhanes_total_activity_data, aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  labs(
    title = "Total activity by age and sex across education levels",
    x = "Age (in years)",
    y = "Total activity (in mims)",
    color = "Sex"
  )

nhanes_total_activity_plot
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_dmh2228_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="90%" />

Younger female participants are more active across all levels of
education compared to younger male participants. Older men are more
active in the first level of education, but less active in both the
second and third level of education. Older women with the highest
education are most active compared to younger women and men, in general.

# 24-hour activity time courses by sex over education levels

``` r
nhanes_24_hour_data =
  final_nhanes_data |>
  group_by(seqn) |>
  mutate(
    minute = as.numeric(minute),
    mims_by_hour = mims/60, 
    hour = minute/60
    )

nhanes_24_hour_plot =
  ggplot(nhanes_24_hour_data, aes(x = hour, y = mims_by_hour, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  labs(    
    title = "24-hour activity by sex across education levels",
    x = "Hours (in a day)",
    y = "Activity (in mims)",
    color = "Sex"
    ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24)
    )

nhanes_24_hour_plot
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_dmh2228_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="90%" />

Male and female participants across education levels and a 24-hour
period have a similar pattern in activity throughout the day. However,
in the highest level of education, there is a greater distribution of
activity over the 24-hour period among both females and males.
