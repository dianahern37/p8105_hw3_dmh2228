# Problem 1: Instacart

``` r
data("instacart")
```

There are a total of 15 variables. There are 1384617 rows and 15
columns. Examples of key variables include order ID, product ID, user
ID, product name, aisle ID, aisle number, etc.

# Number of aisles and most items ordered from aisles

``` r
instacart_df = 
  instacart |>

  summarize(n_obs = n())
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

There are 134 aisles. The aisles that the most items are ordered from
are: fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and packaged vegetable fruits.

# Number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r

In 2002, the states that were observed at 7 or more sites are c(“AZ”,
“CO”, “CT”, “DE”, “FL”, “GA”, “HI”, “ID”, “IL”, “IN”, “KS”, “LA”, “MA”,
“MD”, “ME”, “MI”, “MN”, “MO”, “NC”, “NE”, “NH”, “NJ”, “NV”, “NY”, “OH”,
“OK”, “OR”, “PA”, “RI”, “SC”, “SD”, “TN”, “TX”, “UT”, “VT”, “WA”).

In 2010, the states that were observed at 7 or more sites are c(“AL”,
“AR”, “AZ”, “CA”, “CO”, “CT”, “DE”, “FL”, “GA”, “HI”, “IA”, “ID”, “IL”,
“IN”, “KS”, “LA”, “MA”, “MD”, “ME”, “MI”, “MN”, “MO”, “MS”, “MT”, “NC”,

```

The average data value fluctuates by year for most states.

# Distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State for 2006 and 2010

``` r

```

<img src="p8105_hw3_dmh2228_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

2006 and 2010 have a similar distribution of `data_value` for responses
(“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.

More female participants are in the 3rd level of education compared to
male participants. However, more female participants are in the 1st
level of education compared to male participants as well. There are more
male participants in the 2nd level of education compared to female
participants.

# Total activity by sex across education levels

Younger female participants are more active across all levels of
education. Older men are more active in the first level of education,
but less active in both the second and third level of education. Older
women with the highest education are most active among all those with
the highest level of education. In general, activity does fluctuate by
year.

# 24-hour activity time courses by sex over education levels

``` r
nhanes_24_hour_data =
  final_nhanes_data |>

    hour = minute/60
    )

  ggplot(nhanes_24_hour_data, aes(x = hour, y = mims_by_hour, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  labs(    
    title = "24-hour activity by sex across education levels",
    x = "Hours (in a day)",
    y = "Activity (in mims)"
    ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24)

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_dmh2228_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="90%" />

Male and female participants across education levels and a 24-hour
period have a similar pattern in activity throughout the day. However,
in the highest level of education, there is a greater distribution of
activity over the 24-hour period among both females and males.
